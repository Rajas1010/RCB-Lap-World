**Project Setup:**

2. **Database Creation**:
   - Start XAMPP and ensure that both the Apache and MySQL services are running.
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Log in to phpMyAdmin (default username is "root" and leave the password field empty).
   - Click on the "Databases" tab and create a new database named "project."

3. **Import Database**:
   - Inside the project folder, you should find a file named "project.zip."
   - In phpMyAdmin, click on the "Import" tab.

   - Make sure both Apache and MySQL services are running.

6. **Run the Project**:
   - In the "LapShowRoom" folder, you will find a file named "run.bat."
   - Double-click the "run.bat" file to execute the project.

7. **Interact with the Application**:
