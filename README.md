   - Click on the "Choose File" button, select "project.zip" (not the .sql file inside it), and click "Open."
   - Click the "Go" button to import the database.

**Running the Project:**

4. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   - Open the "LapShowRoom" project folder.

5. **Start XAMPP**:
   - Start XAMPP if it's not already running.
   - Make sure both Apache and MySQL services are running.

6. **Run the Project**:
   - In the "LapShowRoom" folder, you will find a file named "run.bat."
   - Double-click the "run.bat" file to execute the project.

7. **Interact with the Application**:
   - After running "run.bat," the Java application will launch.
   - You'll see the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Laptop Management System.
   - You can interact with the application using the provided GUI to perform actions such as user sign-up, laptop addition, price updates, viewing laptop details, generating bills, and more.

That's it! You've successfully set up and executed your Laptop Management System project. Enjoy using and exploring its features.
